The aim was to create React Native mobile application named ScanDict i.e. Scan Dictionary running on Android and iOS platforms. 
It aids a book reader to scan words from a book with a camera. Consequently, user can tap on the words detected using Google Vision API to obtain meanings along with synonyms or antonyms from Dictionary REST Web Services.
Alternatively, a reader can also type a word to see its meanings.
It also helps to save meanings and delete them if not needed for future use.
